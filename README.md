Are you looking for the **[nengolib documentation](https://arvoelke.github.io/nengolib-docs)**?

This repository is simply hosting the build files produced by running `python setup.py build_sphinx` in the [nengolib repository](https://github.com/arvoelke/nengolib/).
These static files are then served by the above github-pages URL.
This is done to avoid bloating the size of the nengolib repository, and to afford some greater flexibility with managing/versioning the release of new documentation.

The license on this repository applies only to the published documentation. The code itself is [licensed separately](https://arvoelke.github.io/nengolib-docs/license.html).
